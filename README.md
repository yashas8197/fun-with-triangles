# Triangle Calculator

This project is a web application built with vanilla JavaScript that provides features to validate triangles, 
calculate their area, determine the hypotenuse, and includes a trivia quiz. It utilizes different branches for each page and follows a component library approach for code reusability.
## Features

- **Triangle Validation:**  Check if given angles form a valid triangle.
- **Area Calculation:**  Calculate the area of a triangle using base and height measurements.
- **Hypotenuse Calculation:** Determine the length of the hypotenuse in a right triangle using the Pythagorean theorem.
- **Triangle Quiz:** A dedicated quiz page is included to test your knowledge about triangles.
- **Triangle Trivia Quiz:**  Engage in a quiz to test your knowledge about triangles.

## Branches

The project is developed using three branches in Git to manage different stages of development:

1. **main:** The `main` branch contains the stable and production-ready code.
2. **development:** The `development` branch serves as the main development branch, where new features are added and tested.
3. **triangle-validation:** Implements triangle validation feature.
4. **area-calculation:** Implements area calculation feature.
5. **hypotenuse-determination:** Implements hypotenuse determination feature.
6. **quiz-page:** Implements the triangle trivia quiz.
7. **component-library:** Contains reusable components.
